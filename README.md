Ecommerce-vanillajs

Welcome to my Ecommerce-vanillajs project, with this readme I intend to explain a little bit about it, starting with the languages, libraries and tools used to build it,  the idea or concept behind it and the structure of it. Let’s begging: 

The languages, libraries and tools:

This was done mostly with HTML, CSS and Javascript Vanilla.

Thanks to https://www.kunkalabs.com/mixitup/, this librarie helped me to set the filters for the catalog. 

Thanks to @kirzin over at  https://uiverse.io/detail/kirzin/selfish-kangaroo-64 for the styles for the buttons. 

Thanks to my wife for helping me to edit and add the animated effect that shows the avatars waving their hands at the beginning of the “greeting gif”. On that note, thanks to https://www.bitmoji.com/ this is where those avatars were taken from. 

The idea or concept behind it: I focused on creating a website that would portray in the best way possible the personality of the brand, getting the visitors and possible customers engaged with it as much as possible  to push them to take action, that being either contacting the company or completing their purchase on the website. Side note: this is an actual small ecommerce selling mostly through whatsapp, instagram and tiktok, but since they are without a real website as of yet, I’m working on building one for them.  

The structure: 

The navbar: has a burger type menu and an icon for the shipping cart. Animations for the burger menu were done with Javascript Vanilla, CSS and HTML, same for the alert bard on the shopping cart icon once you start adding products to it. 

The greeting gif: this was done, adding a wave motion to two bitmoji avatars, a greeting text with the logo of the brand and also a want type animation, that has to do with Harry Potter being the main inspiration behind their name, following with a few images of their products, I focused on highlighting here those that are not in the mock up catalog just to give the owners of the brand an idea of how much this greeting gif would help them to show their brand personality and also the variety of products they offer. 

The catalog: since the greeting gif has on purpose a position fixed, once we scroll up, we get this roll up type effect, (that I love personally), with in, the catalog we see the title, and a few filters to help a possible buyer to find the products they are interested in a bit easier,   then we get to see some of their products, I focused on the visuals of it, adding a massive image to it, so the user gets to enjoy the designs as much as possible. Side note: The background colors are the actual corporate colors of the brand. 

The contact me section: It has the brands main social media outlets along with their whatsapp contact, allowing any user that clicks on it to be redirected to it, on a new tab. This is at the end, because the concept is to have users that visit the website, purchase through the website, and contact the brand or move away from their website once they’ve gone through all the products available. 

The shopping cart’s body,  this shows once the user clicks on the shopping cart, and it will show an item added to it, a total to pay and a buy button, that as of now, has no actual function attached to it. All products have an “add to cart button” that once clicked it will set the item into the shopping cart’s body once done that, users have to keep adding more units of the same item through the buttons in the item added, not the one on the catalog, this is to prevent an user from adding more units than the ones on stock.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.
